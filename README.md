# Unemployment Analysis: COVID-19 Impact

## Overview
This project leverages Python libraries—**Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**—to analyze comprehensive unemployment data affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. By preprocessing and transforming the data, the analysis compares key economic indicators from pre-lockdown and during-lockdown periods, uncovering actionable insights to support targeted economic recovery strategies.

## Motivation
The COVID-19 pandemic created unprecedented challenges for global economies, significantly impacting unemployment rates. This project aims to:
- **Analyze Trends:** Examine shifts in unemployment and related metrics before and during the lockdown.
- **Identify Correlations:** Reveal relationships between unemployment rates, employment figures, and labor participation.
- **Inform Strategy:** Provide data-driven insights to guide economic recovery and policy decisions.

## Data Description
The dataset encompasses a wide range of unemployment statistics, including:
- **Unemployment Rates**
- **Employment Figures**
- **Labor Participation Rates**
- **Temporal Data:** Markers that differentiate between pre-lockdown and during-lockdown periods

*Note: Ensure the dataset is properly formatted (e.g., CSV, JSON) and preprocessed before running the analysis.*

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing
- **Libraries:** Pandas and NumPy  
- **Techniques:** Data cleaning, missing value imputation, date parsing, and conversion of categorical variables  
- **Goal:** Prepare a clean, reliable dataset for further analysis

### Data Transformation
- **Temporal Filtering:** Segmentation into two time frames:
  - **Pre-lockdown**
  - **During-lockdown**
- **Purpose:** Enable a comparative analysis to highlight changes induced by the pandemic

### Visualization
- **Libraries:** Matplotlib and Seaborn  
- **Visual Tools:**
  - **Bar Plots:** For comparative trend analysis
  - **Swarm Plots:** To explore distribution characteristics of key variables
  - **Correlation Heatmaps:** To identify interdependencies between economic indicators  
- **Outcome:** Visual insights that clarify the pandemic's economic impact and inform recovery strategies

## Results
The analysis highlights significant findings:
- **Increased Unemployment:** A marked rise in unemployment rates during lockdown periods.
- **Interconnected Trends:** Strong correlations between unemployment, employment numbers, and labor participation.
- **Actionable Insights:** Visual evidence that supports targeted strategies for economic recovery.
